This is 7620_back_core_xy mod for use with B76 76x20 blower
I suggest to use SANYO DENKI 9BD24HC6-1 or similar - this is very strong blower and also lighter than 2pcs of 52x15
Please print wider duct and horn
Please print y_max_endstop_angled_endstop_long and y_max_endstop_block_narrow to fit the blower well on the table (move it back without reducing Y size)
for regular prints 30% of flow shall be enough, this also assures very quiet operation. 
Boost Your temperature up in case of higher cooling needs as the blower is quite efficient and can easy make your prints weak due to too much cooling.
